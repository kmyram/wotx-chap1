# Exercise #1: Set up your personal work journal 

Start one today. There are no prerequisites and the sooner you start, the faster you can get to work on it.
Setting it up is as easy as…

- In Slack, you find the channels in the left hand column and click the plus-sign.

- Choose a private channel, give it a proper name, e.g. “henrys-journal” and fill in the description. When you hit “Create Channel” you’re taken to the work journal. Start filling in information and post some messages.
Invite your teammates so you can share with them.

Congratulations! You have a personal work journal.
