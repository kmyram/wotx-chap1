# Exercise #3: Donâ€™t forget to talk to your team

Your personal work journal should hopefully turn into a treasure chest of valuable information over time but think about what kind of information should be shared in the team. The work journal is personal and maybe you should share that new trick with others first - it could probably even be a good conversation starter.

One thing that you may need to get used to, when working in a distributed team, is talking to an empty room. There is a tendency, if you see that nobody else is online, to stay quiet. The challenge for you is to break this wall by getting into a habit of talking to your team even when they haven't arrived yet. When the sun rises in their part of the world, they will see your messages and know that somebody else is out there

A good way to start forming this habit, and a bare-minimum of daily communication, is to say Hello when you start your day. Even if nobody else is online yet, jump in Slack and say something like: "Hi team, I'm ready for a new day". From there you can build on with any interesting things you think everybody should know and not just your journal.
