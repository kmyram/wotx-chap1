# Exercise #2: Use a bot for your daily updates

You will probably get familiar with the daily routine of posting your updates to your work journal very soon. Soon, the channel will be filled with your notes, thoughts, tips and tricks and you may want to separate your daily updates from other postings.

To this end, you can automate the routine by using a bot - it will message you at a certain time and give you predefined questions to use as a sort of template for the daily update. This way your readers know when to expect a nicely formatted update every day. You just have to respond to a simple questionnaire and the rest is put in your journal by the bot.
Setting up your update bot can be done by…

Go to geekbot.io
Click “Add to Slack” button
Choose the X-Team Slack (you may need to log in)
Authorize the Geekbot
On the Dashboard review these settings:
Under “1. Choose members”, verify that your user is listed.


Under “2. Set your stand up questions”, review the questions. This is generic scrum standup questions and your version may vary. If in doubt, use the standard questions but try and see if you can tweak them to better suit the types of entries mentioned above. The challenge is to make sure you have a response that fits every day - think about what you want to tell and what can be exactly what your teammates may want to know.


Under “3. Set the time of the stand ups”, you pick a good time to answer. Depending on where you are located you may want to find a quiet hour, possibly at the beginning of the work day. Ideally, you should not spend very long responding to the questions you have defined so if you want to use the daily update as a break during the day, that could be fine too.


Under “4. Set geekbot's response time”, leave it at default. If you later find out that you prefer to work without Slack running (e.g. closed or on another device) you can set it to message you at a certain delay after you are online.


Under “5. Set your slack broadcast channel”, choose your work journal channel to get the daily update posted there.


Click “Save standup”


Open Slack and invite Geekbot to your work journal channel


Your Daily Update bot is now set up!


Revisit geekbot.io when you want to change settings.

After a while you may want to edit your questions, either the text itself, add more or have less. The important thing is that you adapt it to your situation and it makes sense for you and your readers.
