# Technique #3: Join the conversation

Having an often updated personal work journal and making sure your co-workers are well-informed is a great way of getting accustomed to communicating in a remote team.
In the beginning you will maybe find that it is easier chatting with your team but you’re also in a larger community and everyone is here to contribute.

Much of our culture is the communication we have so try to get a sense for the flow of the channels outside of your own. You need to make yourself noticed by adding to the conversation and sharing your knowledge.

No one expects you to know everything about everything from the first day and you will be hard pressed to find anything harsher than good-spirited banter. Above all, there is a very cultivated sensibility for subtle differences in backgrounds and cultures and a well evolved ability to find the things that unite us and makes us the best team out there.

We are global and Slack is always open. Maybe you’ll end in a long discussion about the wonders of Docker or you can spread your enthusiasm for PHP. Before long you’ll be chatting about the next X-Outpost or just getting the weather report from Melbourne, Australia.

Working remote means making a conscious effort to never be alone and communication is the key. You will learn the jargon really quick and those avatars on the screen won’t just be random entries on the channels but real characters with their own traits. All in the same community as you. Sleep can wait for the next high five. You will never be talking to strangers when you join the conversation.

So don’t hesitate and make yourself known.
