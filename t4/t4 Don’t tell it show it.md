# Technique #4: “Don’t tell it, show it”

The old mantra above is one of the cornerstones of good communication. Now that you are familiar with the basic techniques you can start to hone your skills by refining the way you present the fruits of your labor to others.

Whether in the daily hustle with a project, presenting a new idea or just participating in a discussion it is always more powerful when you can complement your statements with something tangible. When our communication to a large extent is written there is a risk that we don’t always know exactly what another person mean - and by being not only precise but able to present the progress in your work much of that risk is mitigated.

You will not be able to do this all of the time and you should also be aware of when you need to give a simple status and when you need to make sure everyone has the same understanding.

In a situation where you are working on a product, it is important to communicate quite clearly at which stage in the process you are. Consider for example the difference between these two comments:


A: "Today I finished working on the widget."


B: "Today I finished working on the widget, you can take a look here: http://github.com/x-team/greatproject/…"


It’s basically the same, but in B there is a link to back up the statement and it gives your team something they can follow to take a closer look. 
 
Just saying “finished” makes too much room for misunderstanding, because one person's definition of "finished" can be wildly different from another's.

Adopting this will help us to create the kind of visual updates that are easy and enjoyable to follow for others in your team. There are many varying degrees to which we can apply this:

Beyond saying what you did, link to something that shows what you did.


Beyond linking to code, link to the section of requirements documentation that explains why this code is important (and if that doesn't exist, create it!)


Beyond linking to code, link to the section of technical documentation that explains how to run it, so your teammates can view it for themselves.

Note that the ability to link to something is a common thread here. This allows you to pass around information easily. 

Where possible, avoid spending time producing work artefacts that don't have a permalink.
