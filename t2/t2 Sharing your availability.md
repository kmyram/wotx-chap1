# Technique #2: Sharing your availability

Being a remote developer, you have access to work-life flexibility that your office-bound brothers and sisters can only dream of.  Enjoy this freedom, but use it respectfully.
It's important to let your team know what your normal day looks like, and also give them a heads up when there is an exception to the rule.

A good way to do this is:
* Figure out a start and finish time that you can commit to for most days. Make sure that you have overlap with any meetings (daily scrum etc) in your project.
* Make sure that your team know by creating a calendar where your team can access the schedule.
