# Exercise #4: Share your usual working hours with your team and set expectations

To communicate your work schedule, access your calendar at calendar.x-team.com:
Under “My calendars” you can create a new and call it “work schedule”
Under sharing options, share with the organization X-Team
Click “Create this calendar”
Your work schedule calendar now appears in the right column - go to calendar settings for your new calendar
Under “Calendar address” copy the HTML link
Post the link to your work journal under the “Purpose” to make it easily accessible for your team.

Once you've defined the rules, it's easier to talk about the exceptions.  If you know in advance that on a certain day you will need to start more than 30 minutes later than normal, or will have some period of unavailability in the middle, let your team know.
Even if you're just running a little later than normal, let people know because it shows that you respect them.

Make sure to update with other exceptions such time off, travel and other situations out of the ordinary. Maybe you still work the same hours but make a note that you are away for a conference, visiting the client or just not at your usual place.


Don't expect people to remember everything if only posted in Slack, instead make it easier for them to stay updated.
