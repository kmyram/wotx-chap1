# Exercise #5: Choose a day when you will start 30 minutes later than normal, and inform your team via a shared calendar

A couple of days ahead post to Slack and tell the team that you will be starting at a later time than usual and add the link to your calendar which is updated to reflect the change.
Maybe people wonâ€™t remember exactly how much later you were going to be but checking with your calendar the precise times are quickly verified.
